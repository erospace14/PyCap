## Become a Mentor

Mentors are required to guide students in their PyCap courses. This typically involves answering questions about Python or the course material, helping debug Python code, designing and assessing CapStone projects, and contributing to the course material.

As such, mentors should have mastered the basics of Python programming and be able to build functional code for a wide range of mid-level complexity problems.

You can request to become a mentor for the next PyCap course if you believe you meet the above requirements.

## Speak on a Special Topic

If there is a Python-based topic that you are familiar with and are passionate about, and that you believe would be interesting or helpful to the class attendees, you can request to host a class on the topic as part of our Special Topics series. These classes are aimed at people who have completed the Introduction to Python course.

## Write course content

You can request to contribute course content for additional topics that are not already covered in the courses.

## Other contributions

If you would like to make any other contributions to the PyCap materials (for example, to correct typos), you may do so by submitting a pull request to the [PyCap repository](https://github.com/CapgeminiInventIDE/PyCap):

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch in your own fork: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m '<commit_message>'`
4. Push to the original branch: `git push origin <project_name>/<location>`
5. Create the pull request back to our fork.
