## Get to know Python

Python :snake: is a popular and is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.

It is used for many things, such as:

- Software Development
- Web Application
- Scripting
- AI and Machine Learning

As you can see, lots of cool and interesting things to build :satisfied:

## Getting Started

### Instant development environment

We will be using repl.it for this course. It is an online development playground that let you start without any of the hassels to setup. Trust me, I wish I know about it when I was learning Python. :smirk:

To immediately get access to a development environment [click here](https://repl.it/github/CapgeminiInventIDE/PyCap), this should set you up with a repl.it IDE in your browser with all the code in this course. It should look very similar to  the below image.

### Working locally

If you are a little bit brave and interested in working locally on your laptop, you can set up the development environment with the programs listed below :wink:

First ensure you have `git`, `VSCode` and `Python` (3.6+) installed, open up your terminal/command prompt and run the following

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Ensure you download Python 3.6+)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Now you're ready to clone the PyCap repo and open it in vscode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CapgeminiInventIDE/PyCap.git
code PyCap
```
