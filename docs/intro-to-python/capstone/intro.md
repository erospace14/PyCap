# Intro to Python Capstone Projects

The Capstone project is a way to apply all that you've learnt over the course of our Introduction to Python course and get your hands dirty with your own project. It's also a good way to add a repo to your github account to showcase what you've been up to.

Below are the options we have for you to choose for your Capstone project. Each project has been designed by at least 1 mentor who will be available for any questions you might have or guidance for how to approach the problem over the course of the Capstone.

If you're unable to reach your assigned mentor or just have a general Python question, then our team of mentors are available to answer questions that are posted in the PyCap General channel on Teams and other people might have the same questions as you!
